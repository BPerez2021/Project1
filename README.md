# Project1
My first FreeProject from the PDF/Book.
I chose 7-1 to play with making various random sentences.
I had some struggles in the beginning causing anger and frustration, after speaking with some fellow classmates for some advisement and advice I was able to open the project properly and work through my struggles to complete the free exercise. Originally I attempted to open the copied work (per instructions) to VSC but this is where the struggles occured. 
With the kindness of my peers, I was assisted in opening the copied information in Jupyter Notebook. I was then able to run the copied code to view the original code. From there I changed the words as I saw fit in the "subject" and "predicates" lists, added some phrases in the "conjections" list, changed some of the "operators" list, and changed the "if text/ then" text from eye to elephant. All this allowed for different result than the one original given with the copied text.
This project reminded me of the first week and the first reflection's project when we were changing code from the websites, changing the various lists that were running various random result, from sentences, poetry lines, and mash-up words.
